# AOC2020

Late Haskell solutions to [AOC2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). Project structure inspiration taken from https://github.com/haskelling/aoc2020. Code original, except when giving credit.

I'm using this to learn Haskell, so don't expect it to be good or efficient! I started reading about the language and immediately fell in love with it!

## Solutions I'm proud of
- 10b

## Running instructions
- Export your AOC cookie with `export AOC_COOKIE="session:{COOKIE}"`
- Create inputs: `mkdir -p input && cd input && ../src/get 25 && cd ..`
- Run tests: `stack test`
- Run specific problem: `stack run 1a`
